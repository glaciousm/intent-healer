## Implementation Notes

### Visual Evidence Implementation (Priority)

```java
// 1. Add to HealingWebDriver.findElement():
private byte[] captureScreenshot() {
    TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) delegate;
    return ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.BYTES);
}

// Before healing:
byte[] beforeScreenshot = captureScreenshot();

// After successful heal:
byte[] afterScreenshot = captureScreenshot();

// Store in HealEvent:
event.setBeforeScreenshot(beforeScreenshot);
event.setAfterScreenshot(afterScreenshot);

// 2. In ReportGenerator.generateHtml():
VisualDiffGenerator visualDiff = new VisualDiffGenerator();
for (HealEvent event : events) {
    if (event.hasScreenshots()) {
        DiffResult diff = visualDiff.generateDiff(
            event.getBeforeScreenshot(),
            event.getAfterScreenshot(),
            event.getEventId()
        );
        html.append(visualDiff.generateDiffHtml(diff, event.getStep()));
    }
}
```
